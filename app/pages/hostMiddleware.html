	<h1>Host Middleware for MT4</h1>
	<div id="requirements" class="articleSection" style="clear:both">
		<h3>System Requirements</h3>
		
<p>Our middleware is written in <a href="http://socket.io" target="_new">nodeJS</a>/<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_new">socket.io</a>. This provides a Web socket API, allowing you to authenticate MT4 users, retrieve their data, subscribe to real time quotes, trade, and receive other updates from MT4. <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="_new">NginX</a> is used as a reverse proxy and load balancer.</p>

<p>Determining the server specifications that you need to host the middleware depends on a few simple questions:<p>  
<ol>
<li>How many MT4 servers are you connecting to?</li>
<li>How many concurrent users will you have trading on each MT4?</li>
<li>How many instruments will you be trading on each MT4?</li> 
</ol>

<strong><empasis>Example:</empasis></strong> 

<p>Meeting the following <strong>system requirements</strong> will host middleware for <strong>1 MT4 Server</strong> with <strong>160 concurrent users</strong> and <strong>100 subscribed symbols</strong>.</p>

<strong><u>System Requirements</u></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows Server 2012</li>
<li><strong>Processor (CPU):</strong> 2.0+ GHz processor (minimum of 4 cores)</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> 10 GB hard drive</li>
</ul>
